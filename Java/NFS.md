**Network File System** (**NFS**) is a [distributed file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_file_system) protocol originally developed by [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) (Sun) in 1984,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System#cite_note-sun85-1) allowing a user on a client [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) to access files over a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) much like local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the [Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Network_Computing_Remote_Procedure_Call) (ONC RPC) system. NFS is an open IETF standard defined in a [Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) (RFC), allowing anyone to implement the protocol.
